    <Heading>Introducing Spotlight: Get to know your fellow members!</Heading>
    <Text>
      Meeting each other at meetups a few times a year is great for forming new
      connections, but not enough to get to know each other well. We would like
      to make it easier, so we came up with the Spotlight series. It is a
      bi-weekly, short-form series of interviews with NN1 Dev Club community
      members. The same questions every time but a different face and story!

      Let's start with{" "}
      <Link href="https://nn1.dev/spotlight/rob-hough/">Rob Hough</Link>, the
      mastermind behind this initiative, alongside{" "}
      <Link href="https://nn1.dev/spotlight/oliver-ash/">Oliver Ash</Link>, a
      great programmer, speaker from one of our past events, and a great
      contributor to the community. That should give you a little bit of a
      taster. Expect some more every other Friday!
