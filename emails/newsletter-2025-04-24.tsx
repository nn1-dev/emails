      We put a lot of time and energy into building this community. We love it,
      but we've grown tired of constantly searching for event sponsors. Each
      event costs around ¬£500, and we're now turning to you, our community, for
      support. Any funds beyond our costs will go directly to local charities.
      Through Open Collective, you can see exactly how every contribution is
      used, ensuring complete transparency.
