      Our 9th meetup is coming to your town on 27/11/2025. This one is a perfect
      combo of low-level geekiness and some soft skills and product knowledge.
      Emmanuella Okorie is going to introduce us to the high-level theory of
      MCPs, show some practical examples and lay the groundwork for building
      your very own AI assistant. Kiran Patel will be giving a talk about
      effective collaboration between developers and the product team. Two
      fantastic talks!
