      Paul Maddern is going to talk about Z80 assembly and explain the structure of an actual retro game. Richard is going to share his experience and provide some insights after working in the industry for over two decades. Dennis K Bijo is going to go through cybersecurity concepts. Robert Jamborski made a super cool Spotify utility app that he will share with others. Gabriel is going to explain how to make your home networking more secure and private. Nabbil Abbas wants to share his vision of more decentralised networks than the ones we tend to use. Plenty of great stuff!
